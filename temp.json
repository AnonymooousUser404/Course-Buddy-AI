        "description": "The course is designed to teach computational techniques for incompressible turbulent reacting flow, specifically direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES). These techniques will be discussed in the context of atmospheric and ocean modelling, although they are more widely applicable. These high-resolution methods require parallellisation of the flow solvers, and students will learn the principles of parallel computing, and gain hands-on high- performance computing (HPC) experience in the course project. Key topics: • The equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics; conservation of mass, momentum, energy; nondimensional parameters. Forms of the governing equations: compressible, anelastic, Boussinesq (incompressible), shallow-water. • The scales of fluid flow (e.g. in the atmosphere: micro-, meso-, synoptic, planetary scale); suitable forms of governing equations; rotating and stratified flows. • Basics of atmospheric thermodynamics; water vapour and its transformations; dry and moist lapse rates; dry and moist convection. • Turbulence: Kolmogorov (1941) theory; length scales of turbulent flow; resolved and unresolved scales; modelling and closure. History of atmospheric fluid dynamics and turbulence theory. • Numerical methods for the Navier-Stokes equations: discretisation in space: (pseudo- )spectral, finite-difference / finite-volume; collocated and staggered grids; discretisation in time: implicit and explicit time-stepping; error analysis of numerical methods: stability, dispersion, dissipation. • Hierarchy of numerical methods: Direct numerical simulation (DNS), large-eddy simulation (LES), Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulation (RANS); domains of application. • Parallelisation: shared / distributed memory (OpenMP / MPI), communication overheads, weak and strong scaling, acceleration of solvers. • Course project: students will reproduce a peer-reviewed journal article based on DNS / LES. Students will use a suitable open-source numerical solver, or write their own, and deploy these solvers on the IDPCS cluster. Special topics required for specific papers will be covered.",

Our focus is to ask and automatically answer questions on safety, dependability, predicability and performance, such as \"Can the system crash in 30s?\", \"What is the probability of a system failure in the next 24 hours?\" We will start by covering basic quantitative automata models and discuss verification techniques. Then we move onto probabilistic systems and their verification. We then focus on quantitative logics and richer specifications, and finally, cover several application domains especially in and relevant to intelligent systems. Markov chains and Markov decision processes (MDP). In this module, we cover basics of Markov chain theory and its extension to MDPs. We will consider MDPs both from state-based and distributional settings and introduce state of the art verification tools such as PRISM, STORM.Quantitative Automata Models and Verification. This will include Timed Automata and their reachability analysis, Hybrid automata and Weighted Automata. We will also introduce state-of-the-art tools for timed automata including UPPAAL and Tchecker.Quantitative logics, richer specification and reasoning. In this module we consider probabilistic and timed logics and consider model checking algorithms in general. Applications to intelligent systems. This module will include quantitative modeling of decision tree ensembles and neural networks. For all these models, we will consider several properties of interest including robustness, fairness, sensitivity, explainability.",

        "description": "Formal methods and machine learning: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in applications where formal guarantees are desirable. For example, self-driven vehicles use ML components, wrong decisions by which can lead to fatal accidents. The ACAS Xu system for collision avoidance of autonomous drones is another such example, where a neural network is required to satisfy properties rigorously specified in logic. Formal robustness guarantees of image classification networks require the class label to not change until the image is perturbed beyond an acceptable threshold. For various historical reasons, mainstream ML research has focused on development of an extremely rich set of tools, techiniques and models that can be used to perform extremely well in most scenarios, without formal guarantees in all possible corner cases. In this course, we will be primarily interested in the behaviour of ML components in these hard-to-fish-out corner case scenarious. We will study how techniques from formal methods (FM) can be used to provide rigorous guarantees of the behaviour of ML components like deep neural networks (DNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Formal methods have been successfully used to provide rigorous guarantees for hardware and software systems in the past, related work leading to at least three Turing Awards. The application of FM to prove properties of modern ML components, however, presents new challenges due to the scale and size of these ML components, and also because of the specifics of their operation. Over the last decade, this has spurred a lot of interest from both the ML and FM research communities, and formal methods for machine learning is now a routine track in most ML/FM conferences. This course will primarily focus on four threads of research in this area: (i) use of abstraction refinement for analyzing DNNs, (ii) use of specialized constraint solving techniques for reasoning about DNNs, (iii) automata theoretic analysis of RNNs, and (iv) formal methods for explainability and robustness of ML components. The course should be useful for students of both formal methods and machine learning, and lies at the intersection of these areas.",

        "description": "Intention is to cover a reasonable subset of the following topics. Continuous and Discrete Optimization are two important pillars of machine learning. Continuous optimization typically occurs in learning model parameters while discrete optimization problems appear in inference and auxiliary tasks such as feature selection, data subset selection, model compression etc. In the first part of this course, we will cover continuous optimization with applications in machine learning. Topics to discuss will include Convexity, Gradient Methods, Proximal algorithms, Stochastic and Online Variants of mentioned methods, Coordinate Descent Methods, Subgradient Methods, Non-Convex Optimization, FrankWolfe, Accelerated Methods, Lagrange and Fenchel Duality, Second-Order Methods, Quasi-Newton Methods, Gradient-Free and Zero-Order Optimization. We will also cover some advanced topics including non-convex optimization, alternating minimization algorithms and parallel/distributed variants of algorithms. We will ground all these algorithms with applications and loss functions in machine learning (starting from logistic regression, linear regression, svms, matrix factorization right up to deep neural networks). Summarily,in Continuous Optimization we will cover topics such as Basics of Continuous Optimization, Convexity, Gradient Descent, Projected/Proximal GD, Subgradient Descent, Accelerated Gradient Descent, Newton and Quasi Newton, Duality: Legrange, Fenchel, Coordinate Descent, Frank Wolfe, Continuous Optimization in Practice, etc. The second part of this course will cover the fundamentals of discrete optimization. We will start with basic forms of combinatorial optimization (knapsack, s-t cuts/paths, matchings and matroids) and then discuss submodular functions and their applications. We will cover algorithms for submodular minimization and maximization under various combinatorial constraints. We will also discuss discrete probabilistic models such as Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs). We will ground all these algorithmic and theoretical results with real world applications in feature selection, summarization and diversified search, structured prediction, data subset selection and model compression. Summarily, in Discrete Optimization we will cover topics such as Linear Cost Problems with Applications in ML, Matroids, Spanning Trees, s-t paths, s-t cuts, Matchings, Covers (Set Covers, Vertex Covers, Edge Covers), Non-Linear Discrete Optimization, Submodular Functions and Applications in Machine Learning, Submodularity and Convexity, Submodular Minimization, Submodular Maximization, Beyond Minimization and Maximization: Other forms of Submodular Optimization, Discrete Optimization in Practice",

        "description": "This is an advanced course where we will explore how ideas in various fields of mathematics were used by computer scientists and mathematicians enabling progress on several decade longstanding open problems, ushering in several breakthroughs. One important point of view adopted in this class seeks to unify several of these results as consequences of nuanced and improved Matrix Concentration Bounds. We will explore the connections of these results to: * Algorithmic Applications: Algorithm design, discrepancy theory and combinatorics. On the algorithms side, the class will focus on progress on graph and hypergraph sparsification and the progress on the deep Kadison-Singer problem. * Applications in Complexity: On the complexity side, we will see how these techniques led to super polynomial query lower bounds for 3-query-LCCs. * Applications in Combinatorics: On the combinatorial side, applications which the course intends to cover include the Graph/Hypergraph Moore bound and the recent progress (which almost) resolves Feige`s conjecture If time permits, another important junction where ideas from Geometry, Probability and Computing come together are listed below: * Combinatorial Optimization: Understanding integer programming where we allow a richer set of constraints (which in particular, are not required to be linear). * Optimization and Sampling: It is well known that this problem has intimate connections with sampling. We will see how intricate sampling algorithms, with deep roots in probability (in particular Markov Chain and Monte Carlo) can be repurposed to solve optimization problems. * Average Case Analysis: More recently, these Optimization Methods have been used to formulate a new notion of average case hardness for statistical recovery problems. One of the goals of this class is to understand these recent results.",
