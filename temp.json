        "description": "* Softwares for simulation of mechanisms are widely used by the machinery manufacturing industry. However, the manner in which coding needs to be done to allow scaling up of the mechanism complexity is not usually known. The method of formulation of equations necessary for mechanism analysis differs significantly from those usually used in standard textbooks on Theory of Machines (Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery). The first half of this course introduces students to those concepts of equation formulation. * The second part of the course addresses mechanism synthesis, which is defined as design of a mechanism for achieving a task. This is the opposite of mechanism analysis usually taught in a course on Theory of Machines (Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery). Mechanism synthesis is usually not taught in an undergraduate course. * Both mechanism simulation and mechanism synthesis are crucial components of the larger task of designing and building a machine.Generalized coordinates; Kinematic constraint equations for lower pairs; Kinematic constraint equations for higher pairs; Assembly of system of equations for kinematic position analysis of complete mechanism; Method of extending system of equations for kinematic position analysis of mechanism of arbitrary size and complexity; Derivation of equations for velocity and acceleration analysis from kinematic constraint equations for position analysis; Numerical method of solving large system of equations; Pseudo code for forward kinematic analysis of mechanism; Formulation of equations of motion for dynamic analysis of components of mechanisms; Assembly of system level equations for dynamic analysis of mechanisms; Application of dynamic analysis equations for forward and inverse dynamics problems; Pseudo code for dynamic analysis of mechanisms; Alternate method of solving dynamic analysis problem by numerical methods; Classification of kinematic synthesis problems; Graphical method of solving two and three position kinematic synthesis; Coupler curve generation; Rigid body guidance; Function generation; Method of rotation around poles vs method of inversion for linkage synthesis; Solving the function generation problem by Freudenstein`s equations; Solving multiple classes of the mechanism synthesis problem by dyad analysis; Synthesizing dwell, straight line and circular arc generating mechanisms; Alternate mechanisms through cognates; Inflection circle and Euler-Savary equation; Analytical and graphical methods of obtaining inflection circle; Analytical method of obtaining cubic of stationary curvature; Four position function generation and coupler curve generation by point position reduction; Use of circle point and centre point curves for four position rigid body guidance; Graphical five position coupler curve generation; Dead centre problems as a sub-class of function generation",

The setup of a basic planewave based-DFT calculator and the role of different simulation parameters on the obtained results would be discussed. The use of DFT calculator to calculate observable material properties such as bulk modulus, material density, speed of sound in materials, material stability, etc (without using any prior material knowledge) and their comparison with experimentally measured values (from textbook and literature) will be presented. The shortcomings of DFT calculations in predicting electronic bandgaps, handling strongly correlated solids (such as oxides) will be discussed. The course will conclude by presenting beyond-DFT machine learning based methods for accelerated material discovery. Students will work on individual projects where they will demonstrate the use of DFT calculation in their research and/or on an interesting scientific problem. Content: - Basics of programming in Python (different data types, loops, conditional execution, functions, modules, plotting), Python modules-numpy and matplotlib, introduction to atomic simulation environment (ase), ase visualization tools, introduction to unix-based HPC platform for calculations. - Introduction to crystal structures, lattice, basis, surfaces, interatomic interactions, force-fields, pair potentials, shortcomings of force-fields, introduction to DFT theory (basics only for completion). - Setting up DFT calculator via ASE-Python, choice and convergence of results with different DFT parameters, accuracy/speed trade-off, obtaining electronic energies and bandgaps. - Using DFT calculations to get Bulk modulus, material density, speed of sound, formation energies, and other observable material properties. - Under-prediction of electronic bandgaps, over/under bindings, strongly correlated solids, heavy atoms.",
